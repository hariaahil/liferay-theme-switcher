# Liferay 7 Theme Switcher module #

This module is used to dynamically automatically switch themes from one to another, based on a user's roles.

The goal of this module is to facilitate the creation of themes that don't depend on Liferay's in-context edition
controls.

## Installation ##

Deploy the module's OSGi bundles in your Liferay instance

## How to use the module ##

Configuration of the theme switcher is site-specific. To enable the theme switcher on a site, open Liferay's product
menu (the left bar) and go to **Configuration -> Theme switching**

Once in the configuration panel, enable the switcher. You will also have to choose which roles will trigger a theme
switch and which theme will be used when automatically switching.
